# Vulkan Sierpinski Triangle

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to render a Sierpinski Triangle using Vulkan. I have been making this project by following [Brendan Galea's](https://www.youtube.com/@BrendanGalea) Vulkan tutorials. This project hasn't been tested in all operating systems. I had used MacOS with an M2 chip.


## Requirements
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- Vulkan SDK
- GLFW
- GLM

## Building the Project
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AhmetErenLacinbala/Vulkan-Sierpinski-Triangle.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Vulkan-Sierpinski-Triangle`
3. Create a build directory: `mkdir build`
4. Navigate to the build directory: `cd build`
5. Run CMake: `cmake ..`
6. Build the project: `make`

## Running the Project
After building, you can run the project using:
./VulkanTest

## Running the Project with VS Code:
VS Code configurations has been made. So you can just debug your code through the VS Code instead.
